The main reason why we need graceful degredation in websites is to ensure that the site will maintain basic functionality even when conditions like features not working and poor network conditions occur. To do this, service workers play a major role by caching important assets that allow the website to opporate. With these things cached, the user will be able to use certain parts of the site even if their internet suddenly goes out.
